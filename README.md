# 🎯 Graph Traversal Visualizer (BFS & DFS) - Interactive Canvas App
This is an interactive web application that allows users to draw graphs manually on a canvas, choose a traversal method (BFS or DFS), and visualize the order of node visits step by step. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this educational tool is ideal for learning, teaching, and experimenting with graph algorithms.

✨ Features
✅ Draw your own graph

Click on the canvas to add nodes (automatically labeled A, B, C...).

Click two nodes in succession to connect them with an edge.

✅ Select starting point & traversal method

Choose the starting node from a dropdown.

Select BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) as the algorithm.

✅ Visual feedback

Trigger traversal and see the visited nodes listed in order.

Real-time updates directly on the canvas.

✅ Customizable data tracking structure (Planned)

Option to visualize the queue (for BFS) or stack (for DFS).

✅ User guide/instructions included

An on-screen help panel explains how to use the app.

✅ Responsive and accessible UI

Mobile-friendly layout.

Follows web accessibility guidelines (lang tag, viewport, proper element semantics, etc.)
